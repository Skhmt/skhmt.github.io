          </p>

          <h2>Why am I writing about this now?</h2>
          <p>
            This article is a fairly high-level overview of passwords, how they're stored, how they're hacked, and complimentary technologies. I'm not getting into how algorithms are actually implemented nor how databases are hacked in the first place, for example.
          </p>

          <h3>Twitch</h3>
          <p>
            Over the last week or so, a lot of Twitch chatrooms have been experiencing mass bans and other malicious behavior. People have said "Twitch has been hacked", but really it's the accounts of certain mods that have been hacked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Twitch was <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/important-notice-about-your-twitch-account-aaa876745856#.d6dj216fr">actually</a> hacked in late March of 2015. I'm sure many people remember that, when stream keys all expired and everyone was forced to reset their passwords.
          </p>
          <h3>Dropbox</h3>
          <p>
            In late August 2016, 68.6 million Dropbox account details were leaked on the Internet by hackers. Am I concerned? Somewhat. But Dropbox implemented their password database right, by salting and securely hashing the passwords entered after 2012. But even if you haven't changed your Dropbox password since 2012, you're not in a huge amount of trouble... but you really should change your password.
          </p>
          <h3>LinkedIn</h3>
          <p>
            The LinkedIn breach of 2012 initially released about 6.5 million encrypted passwords, one of the biggest of its kind ever. In <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/another-day-another-hack-117-million-linkedin-emails-and-password">May 2016</a>, 117 million additional LinkedIn account details were posted for sale. LinkedIn didn't salt their password hashes, which led to roughly 90% of the passwords being cracked within 3 days.
          </p>
          <h3>VK.com</h3>
          <p>
            Russia's biggest social networking site, VK.com, suffered a data breach in June 2016. 100 million accounts were posted, each containing the first and last name of the user, email address(es), location information, phone number(s), and their <em>plain-text password</em>. Absolutely nothing was done by VK.com to protect their users, and now all their users are screwed.
          </p>

          <h2>What is a plain-text password?</h2>
          <p>
            Say you have a website that requires user login. The least amount of information you need to store about your users is their username and their password. You put that information into a database. When someone wants to login to your website, they send their username and password, and you verify they're the same as what's stored in the database. Simple. And extremely bad, to the point where it should be criminally negligent. While the username is always stored in plain-text, storing the password in plain-text allows anyone with access to the database to see user passwords, be they legitimate employees or hackers.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a hacker or disgruntled employee obtains a copy of the database via methods out of the scope of this article, they just have to look for your username to find your password. If your username was <code>skroob</code> and your password was <code>12345</code>, it would be displayed just as plainly as you see it here.
          </p>

          <h2>How does hashing work?</h2>
          <p>
            So if storing passwords in plain text is bad, what's the solution? Encryption is <em>not</em> the solution. Encryption is the process of obfuscating data with a password. The problem is that the site itself would need to decrypt the password stored in its own database before comparing it to the password you sent when you logged in, so the password to your password must be stored somewhere. If a hacker can get the entire database, he or she can more than likely also get the password to the passwords.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current best practice solution is to hash the password, and has been implemented in operating systems since at least the 1980s. A hash, in its simplest form, takes input data of any size and outputs data of a fixed size. This means that if your data is longer than the output size, you will lose information, and if your data is shorter than the output size, random junk information is gained. A very simple example is the <em>modulus</em> mathematical operation, which is basically the remainder of x / y. So 1 mod 3 = 1, 2 mod 3 = 2, 3 mod 3 = 0, 4 mod 3 = 1, etc. Given the answer and even the divisor (y), it's impossible to determine the dividend (x) because data is lost. Actual hashing functions (such as MD5 or SHA) are much more complicated and have a much bigger output size than the example above.
          </p>
          <p>
            How hashing is implemented is when you first make your account, your username is stored in plain-text as normal, but your password is hashed and stored only in hash form. When you login to the site, your password is sent to the server, it hashes it in the same way that it hashed your password originally, then it compares the two. In that way, even if the database is leaked, the hackers only get your hashed password, which doesn't give them your actual password. But this isn't quite enough for good security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's an example of hashing with SHA-256:
            <br />
            <input type="text" id="hashInput" />
            <em>&gt; SHA-256 &gt;</em>
            <input type="text" id="hashOutput" readonly size="70"/>
            <br />
            Notice that changing a single character completely changes the output!
          </p>
          <p>
            Servers generally (or at least, shouldn't) use a straight-up SHA-256 algorithm to hash your password. Many use an algorithm called PBKDF2, which essentially adds a database/application-specific salt, and re-hashes the same string 1000 to 100,000+ times. This is because most hashing algorithms can be done fairly quickly on modern CPUs and very quickly on modern GPUs, so multiplying the time it takes to check one password by 100,000 also multiplies the time it takes to crack an entire password database by 100,000.
          </p>

          <h2>What is a salt and why do you want it?</h2>
          <p>
            So now your website doesn't store plain-text passwords, but hashed passwords instead. But a hacker that gets your database can either fairly easilly figure out what hashing algorithm you used by analyzing the output, or just get your server's code and read what you're doing. The hacker can then create or find an existing <em>rainbow table</em>, which is a list of input values and the hashed output, usually for any input less than around 9 or 10 characters plus some very common long passwords.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a very simple and short rainbow table of SHA-256:
            <table class="table">
              <thead>
                <tr><td><strong>Input</strong></td><td><strong>Hash</strong></td></tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>d4735e3a265e16eee03f59718b9b5d03019c07d8b6c51f90da3a666eec13ab35</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>3</td>
                  <td>4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>4</td>
                  <td>4b227777d4dd1fc61c6f884f48641d02b4d121d3fd328cb08b5531fcacdabf8a</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>5</td>
                  <td>ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we can continue with this process for every password up to 8 characters in length and maybe go further. We can do this ahead of time so when a password database is leaked online or obtained via hacking, it's very simple to compare the password hash and find the input text. If a password can contain upper case and lower case characters, numbers, spaces, and say 32 additional symbols (all of which are present on an English keyboard) but not unicode characters (such as emojis or foreign language characters), a one character password takes 26 + 26 + 10 + 1 + 32, or 95 guesses. An 8 character password will take a maximum of 95^8 (6,634,000,000,000,000) guesses, which can be computed in day, more or less, depending on your computer. So this really hasn't solved any problems for passwords less than 8, or maybe even 9 or 10, characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer is a salt. A salt is simple a string of random characters that's added to the front (or back, doesn't really matter) of your password before it is hashed. It is stored in plain-text along with your plain-text username and hashed password. Salting your password does not prevent a dedicated hacker from getting your specific password, as an 8 character password will still take a maximum of 95^8 guesses to figure out. The hacker just creates a new rainbow table that does the input as (salt)(input to guess) instead of just (input to guess). What salts do is protect you from pre-computed rainbow tables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's go back to our user <code>skroob</code> with a password <code>12345</code>. If we give him a salt of <code>abcdefgh</code>, when he makes his account, the server will put his new random salt infront of his inputted password and then SHA-256 it. The SHA-256 of <code>abcdefgh12345</code> is <code>434ba46acedf7238e5601befd2240b727ba790e847f7ec2359e6be6fcdfe3e2f</code>. A dedicated hacker decides to crack skroob's password and starts generating a rainbow table with: abcdefgh1, abcdefgh2, abcdefgh3, etc. He gets it after a bunch of guesses and <code>skroob</code> is compromised. But user <code>sanders</code> is not compromised, as his salt is <code>ijklmnop</code> and a rainbow table with inputs starting with <code>abcdefgh</code> is completely useless to any hash with a different salt. So the dedicated hacker has to create a new rainbow table from scratch, starting with: ijklmnop1, ijklmnop2, ijklmnop3, etc. In fact, to break the entire database, he has to create a rainbow table (actually he'd just search until he finds it, as storing the actual rianbow table is pointless in this case) for every single person. This is infeasible in the real world, as instead of doing 95^8 guesses to crack every 8 character password, he's doing (number of users)*95^8 guesses. For Dropbox, that'd mean doing 68.6 million rainbow tables (again, actually just searches) instead of just one. That's the power of giving a random and unique salt to each user. But to reiterate, salting doesn't protect a person from a hacker out to get a specific person. And also, a strong password of 12+ characters is more-or-less immune to rainbow tables regardless of the presence of a salt.
          </p>

          <h2>What is two/multi-factor authentication?</h2>
          <p>
            Enough about hashes and salt and math! What about more than one factor authentication? In the context of security, authentication can take one of three factors: something you know, something you have, and something you are. The most common factor is the first, and takes the form of a password. The next most common factor is "something you have", and in most online contexts takes the form of a phone number, although it can also take the form of a smart card. In reality, it often takes the form of a photo ID card. The last is the least common on the web but exists on many phones and laptops, and often takes the form of a finger print or less commonly, a retinal scan.
          </p>
          <p>
            For an offline example, when you give someone your debit card, you're proving you have the card. When you enter your PIN, you're proving you know something that no one else should know.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's talk about Linus Media Group for a moment. Linus Media Group is the company, founded by Linus Sebastian, that owns various YouTube channels like the popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips/">LinusTechTips</a> that just hit 3 million followers. Earlier this year, they were hacked even though they had two factor authentication. It turns out, making a fake ID card isn't difficult. Hard to believe, right? I mean, who has ever bought alcohol while under-aged?! So a guy figured out the phone number associated with the LMG domain name (via the WHOIS record), figured out which cell service provider was being used, went to an actual store, and claimed he was Linus and lost his phone. He showed his fake ID and got a new phone. When resetting the password to the domain, a text was sent to his new phone. Linus of course discovered this when his phone dropped service, but the damage was done.
          </p>
          <p>
            So 2 factor authentication doesn't stop a dedicated hacker? No, not really. Additionally, when there's a data breach, now your real life phone number is exposed along with your email address, username, and possibly real name. But it does stop casual hackers, essentially by inconveniencing malicious people. A strong password is even better at inconveniencing malicious people.
          </p>

          <h2>What's so bad about password reminder questions?</h2>
          <p>
            There are two schools of thought on the format of these questions. One side thinks that all questions should be factual ("What was the name of your first pet?") rather than subjective ("What was your favorite pet?"), because you might forget your personal preferences between setting up the questions and having to use them, while factual answers won't change. The other side thinks you should only use subjective questions/answers because factual answers can be looked up/researched. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/09/palin-e-mail-ha/">Sarah Palin's email</a> was hacked in this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Really, you should use nonsense answers to these questions. They're basically a backdoor into your account and shouldn't be trusted.
          </p>

          <h2>So how do hacks actually happen?</h2>
          <p>
            The actual method of breaking into a server and stealing a password database is, again, beyond the scope of this article. But after the database is obtained, an effort is made via rainbow tables to reveal as many plain-text passwords as possible if they were hashed without a salt. If the passwords are plain-text, no additional effort is required, but a salted and hashed password database is more-or-less a non-starter. Once you have a list of usernames and/or emails with a known password, you can try that combination on a bunch of other sites. Because people not only use bad passwords, they also use the same passwords across multiple sites. This is how people's Twitch accounts are compromised without people actually hacking Twitch, they've reused their password on other sites and those sites either didn't salt their hashes or didn't even hash the passwords in the first place.
          </p>

          <h2>So what do I do?</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Go to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a> and see if any site you log on to has been breached.
            </li>
            <li>
              If your password is on <a href="http://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords">this list</a>, please re-evaluate your choices in life.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure all your passwords are over 8 characters, are moderately complex, contain no dictionary words nor "leet" spelling of them, and don't use the same password on every site you visit. Using a password manager like <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> can help with this.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't worry about changing your passwords regularly if you have strong passwords that are unique. Frequent password changes are the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/frequent-password-changes-are-the-enemy-of-security-ftc-technologist-says/">enemy of security</a>. But good luck convincing your security office of that.
            </li>
            <li>
              2 factor authentication doesn't usually hurt, but also isn't necessary if you follow #3.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png" /><br />
          <p>
            <em>Note, this isn't actually a great strategy, as everyone knows this comic and has implemented password guessing algorithms that combine random dictionary words. The general takeaway from this is: figure out a sentence that isn't a quote or something and use that as your password. It's easier to remember for you but hard to randomly guess.</em>
