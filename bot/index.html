<p>
  This is a simple page for my bot... for now.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Latest version: <a href="dist/bot0.4b.zip">0.4b (15 Dec 2015)</a></b>
  <br>
  <a href="https://github.com/Skhmt/twitch-bot">Git repository</a> - if you want to see or use the source code. Not required to use the bot.
</p>
<p>
  This bot was made in javascript, html, css, and node-webkit (node.js). I used libraries from <a href="https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc">node-irc</a>, <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">plotly.js</a>, and <a href="https://zenorocha.github.io/clipboard.js/">clipboard.js</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Instructions:</b> download, run the .exe, go to the "Settings" tab, click "Get token", sign in to Twitch, copy the token to include "oauth:", close the pop-up window, paste it into the field next to "Access Token: " and hit "Save token".
</p>

  <b>Change log:</b><br>
  0.4b: added generic BTTV emotes, made the font a little smaller, added !bottime, !streamtime, !laptime, and the ability to choose which time !uptime uses. Added laptime so you can save, for example, the start of a 24 hr stream that !uptime will count from even if your computer crashes. Minor UI changes all around.
  <br>
  0.4a: fixed a bug with !quote that could randomly play a quote even if it was deleted. Also made emoticons a tiny bit smaller to fix the problem with the auto-scroll not working.
